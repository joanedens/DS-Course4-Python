# Course 4 - Python for Data Science
## IBM Data Science Professional Certificate 

At the bottom of each lab is instructions to share them on GitHub. Since the labs are comprehensive, I'm using this repository in lieu of notes.

* Module 1 - Python Basics 
  - PY0101EN-1-1 Expressions and variables
    * int, float, str
    * converting type
    * bool, True, False
    * basic math
    * variables
  - PY0101EN-1-2 Strings 
    * index, negative index
    * contatenate
    * slice
    * stride
    * escape sequences
    * operatons
* Module - Python Data Structures
  - PY0101EN-2-1 tuple=()
    * impression: looking forward to seeing why we use these - they seem awkward to work with.
    * index, negative index
    * concatenate
    * slice
    * len
    * immutability
    * nesting
  - PY0101EN-2-2 list=[]
    * slice
    * concatenate
    * extend
    * append
    * mutability
    * del
    * split
    * aliasing
  - PY0101EN-2-3 - dict{key:value}
    * two column table w/uniqe keys
    * querying value - dict[key]
    * adding - dict[key]=value
    * deleting - del(dict[key])
    * verifying - 'KeyName' in dict
    * listing contents - dict.keys() or dict.values()
  - PY0101EN-2-4 - set={}
    * lists with only unique elements
    * typecast list to set - set(list)
    * set.add()
    * set.remove()
    * set1.intersection(set2) or set3=set1&set2
    * set1.union(set2)
    * set1.diference(set2)
    * set3.issubset(set1)
    * set1.issuperset(set2)
* Module - Python Programming Fundamentals
  - PY0101EN-3-1 Conditions and Branching
    * ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
    * strings compared by ascii value, characters judged in order
    * if, else, elif (else if)
    * and, or
  - PY0101EN-3-2 Loops
    * impression: 
      - lab/lesson inconsistencies in required program steps and syntax for () starting to drive me batty.
      - don't forget to include statement to ensure loop stops if all compares are valid
    * range(start, stop, [step]) - results never include stop value, stop is only required value
    * for
    * while
  - PY0101EN-3-3 Functions
    * built-in
    * created
      - def functionname(arg1, *args)
        - statement/internal variable/"""help description"""
      - global variable
  - PY0101EN-3-4 Exception Handling
    * try/except
    * else
    * finally
  - PY0101EN-3-5 Objects and Classes
    * Not sure learned what was supposed to here. After being given tons of examples of "create objects with these two attribute variables and a function to use to modify one of the variables." Then we were given a complex exercise to create a class based on manipulating and filtering text... 
    * Will see if can work with what stuck in brain to move forward. If not, will have to go find another tutorial to fill in the blanks. Not helpful.
    * Objects & Classes
    * Creating classes
    * Attributes
    * Methods/functions
* Module - Working with Data in Python
  - PY0101EN-4-1 Reading Files with Open
  - PY0101EN-4-2 Writing Files with Open
  - PY0101EN-4-3 Pandas with IBM Watson Studio
  - PY0101EN-4-4 One Dimensional Numpy
  - PY0101EN-4-5 Two Dimensional Numpy
* Module - APIs and Data Collections
  - PY0101EN-5-1 Introduction to API
  - PY0101EN-5-2 Watson Speech to Text and Language Translator API
  - PY0101EN-5-3 Access REST APIs & Request HTTP
  - PY0101EN-5-4 Webscraping
  - PY0101EN-5-5 Working with Different File Formats
